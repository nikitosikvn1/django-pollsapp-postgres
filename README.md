# django-pollsapp-postgres
## This is my first django web application

The Web Application allows you to:
- Create polls through the admin site (questions and answers to them)
- Vote in created polls
- View voting results
- Aggregate voting results as charts with Charts.js
- Search questions using the search form

I used PostgreSQL as database
